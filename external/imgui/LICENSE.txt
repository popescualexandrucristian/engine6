This is not the original version of the library for that please visit https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/commit/f039e69b9cb3434eb1bdfc764cb2b37afe50d275
This is a modified version by Popescu Alexandru-Cristian(popescualexandrucristian@gmail.com) 
	- it uses VMA for memory allocations.
	- fixes some issues that I had with dynamic rendering.
	- it uses shaders from the target program where it is deployed.

See imgui.diff for details.
